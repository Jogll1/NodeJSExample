To check node version: 'node -version'
To run a file: 'node filename.js' or to run index.js just 'node .'

Nodes in-built file system is called fs.

To export functions from another module use: 
In index.js:
const myModule = require('./myModule'); //if in the same directory, if not write the path
In the module file write:
module.exports = {
    myFunction
};
This lets you use myFunction in index.js

NPM:
Lets you use packages
To initialise it in your project, write in the terminal: 'npm init -y'
This will create a package json file

A very popular and useful package is 'express'
To install write in the terminal: 'npm install express'
Adding this package will add a 'package-lock.json' file and a node_modules folder.

To import express write in index.js:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

To tell express you want to use the files in the folder 'public' write in index.js:
app.use(express.static(_dirname + '/public'));

Git and GitHub:
Assuming you're using visual studio code:
Once downloaded git, click the source control button on the side of visual studio code or

'git init' to intialise the project, this will add all existing files to the changes panel
'rm -rf .git' uninitialises git if you want to remove the repository

Downloading GitLens is helpful for vscode too

Creating a '.gitignore' is helpful as it removes certain files from your source control
Add '/node_modules' to this file to remove the 'node_modules' folder
To help make a .gitignore file, install the gitignore extension by CodeZombie
Then search '>git' and click 'Add gitignore' and type 'Node' to get the node.js gitignore template

To make a commit type in the terminal: 'git add .' to prepare to commit all files
'git reset .' will reverse (unstage) these files
A tip is to make small commits
